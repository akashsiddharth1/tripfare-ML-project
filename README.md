ðŸš• Trip Fare: Predicting Urban Taxi Fare with Machine Learning
This project aims to accurately predict taxi fares in urban environments using machine learning techniques, leveraging a rich dataset of historical taxi trips. The workflow covers the entire data science pipeline: from data loading and cleaning, through feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA), to model building, evaluation, and deployment with a user-friendly Streamlit app.

Project Highlights
Data Understanding:
Loaded and explored a real-world taxi trip dataset, checking for missing values, duplicates, and data types to ensure data quality.

Feature Engineering:
Created insightful features such as trip distance (using the Haversine formula), time-of-day indicators (AM/PM, night flag), weekday/weekend flags, and converted timestamps to local time (EDT). These features help capture patterns like rush hours, night rides, and weekend effects on fare prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized and analyzed relationships between fare, distance, passenger count, time, and more. Identified outliers and trends, such as peak demand hours and fare distributions across different periods.

Data Transformation:
Handled outliers, fixed skewness in continuous variables, and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Selection:
Applied correlation analysis and model-based feature importance to select the most relevant predictors for fare estimation.

Model Building & Evaluation:
Trained and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Models were evaluated using RÂ², MSE, RMSE, and MAE. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize performance.

Deployment:
The best-performing model was saved and integrated into a Streamlit web application. Users can input trip details (locations, time, passenger count, etc.) and receive an instant fare prediction.
